### Daily diet diary

In this challenge, I developed an API for daily diet control, the Daily Diet API.

### Application rules

- It must be possible to record a meal made, with the following information:
- Name
- Description
- Date and Time
- Is it within the diet or not
- It must be possible to edit a meal, being able to change all the data above
- It must be possible to delete a meal
- It must be possible to list all of a user's meals
- It must be possible to view a single meal
- The information must be saved in a database

All of this must be done using a REST API with Python and Flask.
